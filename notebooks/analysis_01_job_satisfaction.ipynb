    "## Job Satisfaction\n",

    "\n",
    "Do developers who frequently visit Stack Overflow report higher job satisfaction?\n",

    "- Import Libraries: Start by importing libraries you'll need for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.\n",
    "- Load Data (Optional): If the data is stored in the \"data\" folder, use appropriate functions to load it into the notebook environment.\n",
    "- Data Understanding: Briefly describe the data, including column names and data types.\n",
    "- Data Preparation: This will involve handling missing values, converting data types if needed, and cleaning any inconsistencies.\n",
    "- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform relevant Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques like descriptive statistics, visualizations (histograms, scatter plots) to understand the distribution of variables and relationships between them.\n",
    "- Modeling (Optional): Depending on the question, you might choose to use statistical tests, correlations, or even simple machine learning models (e.g., linear regression). Clearly explain the chosen approach and why it's suitable.\n",
    "- Visualization: Create clear and impactful visualizations to communicate your findings visually (bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps).\n",
    "- Results and Conclusion: Summarize your key findings related to the specific business question being addressed in the notebook. Tie back these findings to the initial question and the data you analyzed."

Furthermore we should check how often the visit Stack overflow, if they take Part in answering Questions and if they have an Account on that Platform. So We need SOVisitFreq, SOAccount, SOPartFreq.
